## The project
This project is part of my journey in learning to code with [Start2Impact University](https://www.start2impact.it). This is my second project with JavaScript language, and concludes JavaScript Advanced unity.
<br>
Created in 2023

### Prerequisite
The assignment for this project was to built a website with a searchbar. If the user writes the name of a city inside this searchbar it will appear data about the quality of life in this city.
<br>
All the information were provided by [Teleport](https://developers.teleport.org/api/)

### Technical requisite 
- App must be developed with JavaScript
    - Javascript external libraries are recommended, but not mandatory
    - Upload the website using GitHub
    - Using Webpack
    - Write a complete README file
- Addictional features are welcome

## Design inspiration 
I'm not a good graphic designer, so part of my preparatory work consist of search for inspirational work. For this project i have 2 main source:
- The work of a colleage in the [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it) course you can see [here](https://bestcitiestolive.netlify.app). I reall like the clear design of it, expecially the upper part of the website with the city photo.
- It was a pure coincidence, but soon after I had seen my cooeague project I visited the [Teleport](https://developers.teleport.org/api/) website to examine the API information. I noticed the structure of the two website were similar, bit i liked more the subdivision of the spaces in this one.

### Git clone
Type in the terminal
`git clone https://github.com/francesca-pizzighini/find-your-city.git`
Then open the project folder in your code editor and make sure the terminal is now indicating this folder.

### Install dependencies
